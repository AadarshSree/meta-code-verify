Code Verify is an extension for verifying the integrity of a web page.

The idea is you can publish what JavaScript should appear on your site into a "manifest". The manifest consists of the hashes of all the JavaScript files in a given release. This browser extension can consume the manifest and verify that *only* that code executes, or else display a warning to the user.

## Installation

You can install Code Verify from the extension store of [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-verify/llohflklppcaghdpehpbklhlfebooeog), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-verify/#:~:text=The%20new%20Code%20Verify%20is,inauthentic%20or%20has%20been%20modified.), or [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/code-verify/cpndjjealjjagamdecpipjfamiigaknk#:~:text=Code%20Verify%20will%20immediately%20alert,and%20hasn't%20been%20modified.).
